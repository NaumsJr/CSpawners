Repo for CSpawner Plugin by NaumsJr

Currently in Development Stage.

Works in 1.13.X - 1.14.X but doesn't have 1.14 mobs added yet. While it will load in anything below 1.13 it won't craft because the item stack for spawner changed and a lot of item names also changed. Working on a fix but not the highest priority. That will only really increase the amount of server versions that can use it.
