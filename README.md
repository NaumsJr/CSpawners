Repo for CSpawner Plugin by NaumsJr

Currently in Development Stage.

Works in 1.13.X - 1.14.X but doesn't have 1.14 mobs added yet. This is currently only supported in 1.13 onwards due to Minecraft changing the id's of items. While this is something I want to fix eventually making it compatible with lower server versions this is not a high priorty.

1.14 Mobs will probably be added in CSpawners v1.0.00-alpha-D!

## v1.0.00-alpha-C Release Notes
>Changelog
>
>*Added*
>- All mobs up to and including 1.14 should be included now.
>- Command to get a mob type has been added ```/getspawner <mob type>```
>- Added some version checking to get ready for adding 1.14 mobs but not having the recipe load if the server is running below that. This will also be useful when/if backwards compatibility is added.
>
>*Removed*
>- Any backwards compatibilty has been removed at this time meaning any servers below 1.13 should load the plugin with errors and not be able to use any of the plugins features.
