Repo for CSpawner Plugin by NaumsJr

Currently in Development Stage.

Works in 1.13.X - 1.14.X but doesn't have 1.14 mobs added yet. This is currently only supported in 1.13 onwards due to Minecraft changing the id's of items. While this is something I want to fix eventually making it compatible with lower server versions this is not a high priorty.

1.14 Mobs will probably be added in CSpawners v1.0.00-alpha-D!
